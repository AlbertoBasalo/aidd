Good morning; my name is Warren, and I am the CFO of Astro Bookings Corporation.

I'm just writing to tell you how our company makes money.

We charge customers in advance for the seats they reserve on each reservation.

Our vendors also charge us for the successful launches they make through our platform.

In the meantime, we make a financial profit from that money.

We also charge vendors a fee for using our platform for each launch operated, even if it is aborted.

We generate the invoices issued and store those received.

Customers and suppliers must have a tax identification number and a legal address to comply with tax regulations.

We need to track the payment status of those invoices (pending, completed, failed) and the date the payment occurred.

We will invoice the supplier for each successful launch operated on our platform. The fee will be 1% of the total revenue from the launch. After two releases, we will reduce the cost to 0.8%.

If the launch is aborted, we will charge the supplier a fee of 1000 USD for the operative costs and refund the money to the customers with the total amount of the booking aborted.

On the customer side, we will issue an invoice for each booking with the total cost of the seats reserved.

If the customer cancels the booking, we will refund some of the money in certain situations. The amount will be 90% of the total cost if the cancellation is made one year before the launch and 70% if made three months before the launch. After that, the customer will not be refunded, and the seats will be considered sold due to the launch preparation time.

Every invoice must have a number, a legal date, and an amount. Invoices have a payment record with a status that our employees can update.

Of course, each invoice must be related to a booking (when issued to a booking customer) or a launch (when issued to a launch supplier) and must have a recipient (booking customer or launch supplier) and an emitter (Astro Bookings Corp. or launch supplier).

Invoices issued by us, need to be sent as notifications by email to the recipient.

I hope you and your family are safe and well.

> Warren R. Morris, Astro Bookings C.F.O.
