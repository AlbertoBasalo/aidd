# AstroBookings: Core API Logging and Monitoring Scenarios

> Generated on: Monday, August 12, 2024, 16:30 PM UTC

## User Story 3
As a `System`, I want to **log all significant events and errors** *so that IT operators can monitor and troubleshoot the system effectively*.

```gherkin
Feature: System Event and Error Logging

Scenario: Log user authentication attempts
  Given a user attempts to authenticate
  When the authentication process completes
  Then the system should log the event with the following details:
    | Timestamp | Event Type | User ID/Email | IP Address | Result    |
    | [TIME]    | AUTH       | [UID/EMAIL]   | [IP]       | [SUCCESS/FAIL] |

Scenario: Log critical system error
  Given a critical error occurs in the system
  When the error is detected
  Then the system should log the error with the following details:
    | Timestamp | Event Type | Error Code | Error Message | Stack Trace |
    | [TIME]    | ERROR      | [CODE]     | [MESSAGE]     | [TRACE]     |

Scenario: Log data reconciliation process
  Given the data reconciliation process starts
  When the process completes
  Then the system should log the event with the following details:
    | Timestamp | Event Type | Process    | Records Processed | Discrepancies Found | Time Taken |
    | [TIME]    | RECONCILE  | CustomerDB | [NUMBER]          | [NUMBER]            | [SECONDS]  |

Scenario: Log sending notification job
  Given a notification job is initiated
  When the job is processed and the notification is sent
  Then the system should log the event with the following details:
    | Timestamp | Event Type | Job ID | Notification Type | Recipient | Status    |
    | [TIME]    | NOTIFY     | [JID]  | [TYPE]            | [EMAIL]   | [SUCCESS/FAIL] |
```

## User Story 4
As an `ITOperator`, I want to **retrieve system logs** *so that I can analyze system behavior and identify issues*.

```gherkin
Feature: Retrieve and Analyze System Logs

Scenario: Retrieve logs for a specific time range
  Given the ITOperator needs to analyze logs
  When they request logs between "2024-08-11 00:00:00" and "2024-08-12 23:59:59"
  Then the system should return all logs within that time range
  And the logs should be in chronological order

Scenario: Filter logs by event type
  Given the ITOperator needs to analyze specific events
  When they request logs with event type "AUTH"
  Then the system should return only logs with the "AUTH" event type
  And the logs should include both successful and failed authentication attempts
```
