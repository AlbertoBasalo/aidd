Hi, I’m Richard Mezzos, I’m writing to ask you to develop a comprehensive software platform tailored to our unique needs and operations.

We are in need of a robust and future-proof platform that can cater to our unique requirements and enable us to offer our customers extraordinary space trips.

Our business model revolves around being an intermediary between large affiliated suppliers and high-end travel customers. We will charge our suppliers a fee for utilizing our platform.

We need to be able to offer our customers the possibility to book seats on rockets to travel to space. We will charge them for the seats they reserve in every booking.

We need to be able to offer our suppliers the possibility to schedule new rocket launches and manage customers' bookings. We will charge them for the launches they make through our platform, and they will charge us for the bookings of successful launches.

We hope that you will provide us with an evolutionary solution that will allow our suppliers, employees, and customers to easily offer, manage, and book rocket launches.

Of course, we also want to notify our clients and providers of each reservation cancellation or issue on any launch.

**Money is not a problem. But we want a full operating service by the end of 2024.**

In the following days, you will receive specific requirements from our operations, marketing, and technology departments.

Regards,
